# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview
This document outlines the requirements for developing a backend system for an eCommerce shopping platform similar to Amazon. The system will be built using .NET 8, ASP.NET Core Web API, SQL Server, and MassTransit via RabbitMQ. The architecture will follow a microservices and onion architecture pattern, ensuring that no business logic is written in controllers. All business services will be encapsulated within a dedicated `Services` folder.

## Technologies
- .NET 8
- ASP.NET Core Web API
- SQL Server
- MassTransit via RabbitMQ

## Architectural Design
- **Microservices Architecture**: Each service will be independently deployable and scalable.
- **Onion Architecture**: The system will be designed to ensure separation of concerns, with a focus on domain-driven design.
- **Service Layer**: All business logic will be encapsulated within services located in a `Services` folder.

## Development Guidelines
- Each service should be developed following Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for each service
- Use Docker containers for consistency across environments
- Implement API versioning from the start
- Follow REST API best practices
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Use async/await patterns for better performance
- Implement circuit breakers for service communication
- Use health checks for all services
- Implement Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all services
  - Include detailed API descriptions
  - Document request/response models
  - Provide authentication requirements
  - Include example requests and responses
  - Group endpoints by functionality
  - Document all possible response codes

## API Documentation
Each microservice will include comprehensive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation that provides:
- Interactive API documentation using Swagger UI
- Detailed endpoint descriptions and usage instructions
- Request and response schema definitions
- Authentication and authorization requirements
- Example requests and responses
- Error handling documentation
- API versioning information
- Rate limiting details
- Integration examples

## Infrastructure Requirements
- Kubernetes cluster for orchestration
- Redis for caching
- Elasticsearch for search functionality
- MongoDB for analytics data
- SQL Server for transactional data
- RabbitMQ for message queuing
- Azure Blob Storage/AWS S3 for file storage
- CDN for static content delivery

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users and transactions.
- **Security**: Ensure data protection and secure transactions.
- **Performance**: Optimize for fast response times and minimal latency.
- **Reliability**: Ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

## Conclusion
This PRD outlines the foundational requirements for building a robust and scalable eCommerce backend system. Each service will be developed independently, adhering to the principles of microservices and onion architecture, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and maintainability.
